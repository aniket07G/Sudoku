## About the App

Sudoku is a classic logic-based number puzzle played on a 9Ã—9 grid, divided into nine 3Ã—3 sub-boxes. The objective is to fill the empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9 so that each number appears only once in each row, each column, and each of the nine 3Ã—3 boxes.

Our Sudoku app brings this timeless puzzle to your mobile device with a smooth and polished experience. It's designed for players of all skill levels, from beginners who need a little help to experts looking for a true challenge.
